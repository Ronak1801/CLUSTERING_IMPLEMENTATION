# CLUSTERING_IMPLEMENTATION
K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. Implement KMeans Clustering Algorithm over the dataset given below. Make sure you also plot the scatter chart for the same.
